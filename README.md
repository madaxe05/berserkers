### Problem Statement

Food waste is a growing urban challenge in developing countries like Nepal. Restaurants, hotels, and food outlets generate large amounts of leftover food daily, most of which ends up in landfills. This creates multiple interconnected problems affecting the environment, economy, and governance.

### Solution Overview

Anna-Chain is a circular economy web platform that connects restaurants generating food waste with farmers who need affordable animal feed. The system includes AI-assisted rule-based safety verification to ensure only suitable waste is redistributed. It provides an environmental impact dashboard showing CO₂ reduction, waste diverted, and carbon credits earned. Restaurants gain green rewards and sustainability recognition, while farmers access low-cost local feed.
