# Anna-Chain: Smart Food Waste Redistribution

Anna-Chain is a circular economy platform designed for Nepal that connects restaurants with farmers to transform food waste into valuable animal feed. By streamlining this connection, we reduce methane emissions from landfills and provide affordable feed alternatives for the agricultural sector.

## 🚀 Vision
Our mission is to build a sustainable, tech-driven food waste ecosystem that rewards restaurants for their environmental contribution and empowers farmers with high-quality resources.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- **Restaurant Waste Upload**: A streamlined interface for restaurants to list food waste with detailed descriptions.
- **AI-Powered Safety Verification**: Uses rule-based classification to verify waste safety for animal consumption based on food categories.
- **Farmer Marketplace**: A real-time dashboard for farmers to browse, buy, and coordinate pickups of available feed.
- **Impact Dashboard**: Visualizes environmental contributions including CO₂ saved, waste diverted, and trees equivalent.
- **Green Rewards**: Track environmental impact and carbon credits earned by participants.
